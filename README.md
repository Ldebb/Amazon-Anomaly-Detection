This Capstone project was done as a part of my data science course.
## Business Problem

- The e-commerce sales are surging which has increased the significance of online reviews and product ratings in influencing the decisions made by the users in day-to-day life. The users make use of these ratings and reviews to help them to make their respective purchases. However, there have been instances where these product ratings and reviews given by a customer do not synchronize with each other, which leads to the downfall of the reliability of the customer ratings. This gives birth to anomalies present between the ratings and reviews given by a customer.

- In this project, addressing detecting anomalies in online reviews and ratings using an unsupervised approach. Most importantly, with the help of the models are explicitly labeling whether the anomaly or not an anomaly for the data.
